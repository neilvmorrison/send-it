# SendIt - Open Source Forum

## Introduction

In the wake of Reddit's ostensible suicide by paywalling their API to the tune of US$20M yearly, a demand has arisen for a reddit-like application free from VC meddling . This is the zeroth iteration of that application

## Development

To begin development on the application:

1. Checkout the repository - you've done that already because you're here.
2. Install deps `yarn install`
3. Populate `.env` with your credentials
4. `yarn dev`
5. Make something better than me.

## Stack

SendIt is build on NextJS and leverages AWS for its data persistence and authentication layers.
